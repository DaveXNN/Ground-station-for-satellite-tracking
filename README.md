# Ground station for satellite tracking
This repository contains a description of the project Ground station for satellite tracking. The goal of this project was to build a ground satellite station that is able to receive signals from satellites operating at VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency). The ground station constists of rotator, antennas, polarization switcher, receiver and station computer (laptop). Each part is describet in separate chapter.

## Rotator
Unfortunately, a lot of these satellites are situated on the LEO (Low Earth Orbit), in other words below the altitude of 2 000 km. It means that the satellite changes its position very quickly and it's very uncomfortable to change antennas' direction manually, because it may cause a loss of the satellite signal. A rotator is a good solution of this problem, because this device moves the antennas automatically with very high precision.

Of course there are many proffesional rotators available to buy in the internet e.g. Yaesu, but i decided to build a similar rotator by myself, because it's cheaper option and I really wanted to get into this field of problems.

Each satellite has data about its position in the Earth orbit called TLE (Two-Line Element). They are updated every 2 hours from URL: https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=ACTIVE&FORMAT=tle. This rotator uses the latest TLE data to predict satellite visibility in a specific location on the Earth. For satellite visibility prediction is used python beyond library (https://pypi.org/project/beyond/). Here is an example of TLE for the International Space Station or Czech satellite Planetum-1:

```

If we have the latest TLE data, we can track each satellite in the Earth orbit. This rotator is designed primarily for tracking satellites in the low Earth orbit (LEO), it means below an altitude of 2 000 km.

For the next sections we need to define two important variables - azimuth and elevation of a satellite. Azimuth and Elevation are measures used to identify the position of a satellite flying overhead. Azimuth tells you what direction to face and elevation tells you how high up in the sky to look. Both are measured in degrees. Azimuth varies from 0째 to 360째 and elevation from 0째 to 90째.

The whole rotator is controlled by computer [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) via digital GPIO pins. Raspberry Pi is connected with two stepper motor drivers, two rotary encoders and a magnetometer.

The rotator has to follow satellite's azimuth and elevation, so we need two stepper motors and two drivers. Here is a list of electronic components:
